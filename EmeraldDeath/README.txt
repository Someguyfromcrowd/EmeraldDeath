This is a simple plugin that causes players to drop emeralds proportional to their experience level upon death.

Created for realiez.

------

config.yml:

baseEmeralds: The number of emeralds to always drop on death; must be > 0
emeraldsPerLevel: The number of emeralds to drop per level of the player; must be > 0
stackSize: The largest number of emeralds that the plugin will spawn at once. Turning this down may cause the emeralds to scatter more, but they'll still probably clump up. Must have a value of 1 to 64.
